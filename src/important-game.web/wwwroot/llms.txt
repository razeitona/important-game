## Overview

Match to Watch is a platform dedicated to helping football enthusiasts identify the most thrilling matches
to watch from the hundreds of games played each week. Our unique Excitement Score (ES) system analyzes
various factors to predict how exciting a match will be, ranging from 0 to 100.

### How It Works

The Excitement Score algorithm considers multiple factors:

- **Historical Rivalries**: Classic rivalries bring extra intensity
- **Form & Momentum**: Recent team performance and playing style
- **League Standings**: Title races, relegation battles, top-4 fights
- **Head-to-Head History**: Past encounters and competitiveness patterns
- **Fixture Importance**: Cup finals, derbies, crucial seasonal matches
- **League Quality**: Top-tier competitions feature higher quality football

We also track matches in real-time, updating excitement scores based on live events such as goals,
cards, and possession battles. This means users can discover thrilling matches even after they've kicked off.
